Hello, my name is Shady Shamy and I will be graduating with my Master's in Nutritional Science from Chico State in May 2024. I completed my Bachelor's in Biological Sciences from UC Irvine where I found nutrition's holistic approach to health care to be quite compelling. I'm interested in pursuing a career as a clinical dietitian and as a researcher where my research interests include public health and diet-related research. I plan on applying to dietetic internships to become a registered dietitian and to work as a clinical dietitian at a hospital while pursuing research on the side. For fun, I look to go to the gym, play basketball and spend time with friends and family.

I believe that being dependable and communicative is crucial to having a functional team, and being caring and compassionate is essential to giving patients the proper care.
