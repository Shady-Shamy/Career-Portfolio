In this project, I worked in teams to develop a research project, develop a qualitative research questionnaire, conduct qualitative interviews with participants, and analyze the data. Our group chose to do our project on the impact of childhood experiences on students' eating habits. We conducted a literature review on this topic to identify any gaps in the literature. Then, we created our own qualitative interview questions, recruited participants, and conducted our own interviews. Lastly, we analyzed the transcripts from all of the participants and identified important themes that were present. This was the very first time that I had worked on a qualitative research project. Most of my experience has been in quantitative measurements and being able to get experience in a qualitative approach helped me better understand how this type of research is conducted. This is an important topic in the nutrition field as being able to understand both quantitative and qualitative topics is crucial.

One of the projects that I have worked on extensively with the Center for Healthy Communities is the Basic Needs and Student Success Survey. This project involves surveying college students in California on a variety of factors such as the impact of basic needs resources, eating habits, physical activity patterns, and mental health. We have recruited over 2000 student participants for the statewide study and have summarized all the results on a website using GitHub and R studio. This was a very large project involving the effort of multiple people in developing the survey, collecting the data from 12 college campuses, cleaning all the data, and analyzing the data. I learned how to work in a large team and how to display complex graphs and tables to be easily interpreted by the general audience. These are all important skills as being able to work in large teams is crucial in the healthcare field and being able to provide and explain complex information in simple terms is important to ensure that patients understand the information given to them.

In this project, I worked in a team to create a small research project to assess an important gap in the literature. As a team, we created our own survey using Qualtrics including validated survey tools, distributed this survey, and used SPSS to analyze the data. My analysis focused on assessing the association between stress and appetite where I used a linear regression model with various covariates. I found a positive association between stress and appetite among college students. In other words, as college student's stress levels increased, there was an association with an increase in college student's appetites. This was the first research project that I had conducted, and I learned how to develop and organize a research project. This is relevant to the nutrition field as being able to understand research and research methodology is crucial to implement evidence-based practice.
