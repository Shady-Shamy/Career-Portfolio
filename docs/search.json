    "text": "Evidence Analysis on Ashwagandha’s Effects on Stress, Depression, and Anxiety\n\n\nView Project\n\n\n\nIn one of my classes, about dietary supplements and functional foods, we conducted our own literature review about a certain supplement and posed our own conclusions on the efficacy of that supplement on treating a certain condition. I chose to research ashwagandha and stress since there have been a lot of supplement companies selling ashwagandha as a stress reliever and I wanted to evaluate the evidence. Through this project, I further increased my ability and skills to research a certain topic and use that evidence to make an unbiased conclusion. This will be helpful in the future working as a dietitian as I am sure there will be a lot of questions from clients asking about certain supplements. Being able to dive into the research is crucial to see if there is actually any benefit to taking a certain supplement and providing this information without any bias is also important.\n\n\n\n\nPregnancy Project\n\n\nView Project\n\n\n\nIn a class on nutrition throughout the lifecycle, one of our projects was to conduct a 24-hour dietary recall on a pregnant woman and identify any potential nutrient deficiencies based on the recommended dietary intakes. After conducting the dietary recall, I entered all of the food eaten by that person into a nutrition database to calculate macro and micronutrient intake. We then wrote a report on these findings and wrote about recommendations to improve the patients’ nutrition. In this experience, I learned how to conduct a 24-hour dietary recall and learned how to identify any nutrient deficiencies through the use of a nutrition database. These are very important skills to know as dietitians where we will be conducting many 24-hour dietary recalls or just gathering general dietary intake. Knowing how to gather the right information is crucial in order to make appropriate recommendations. This is especially important in pregnant women where inadequate nutrient intake may be common.\n\n\n\n\nEvidence Analysis on Sucralose, Blood Sugar, and Insulin Levels\n\n\nView Project\n\n\n\nIn a class on Advanced Human Nutrition, I worked in a team to write a report on a controversial topic. My group chose to research how an artificial sweetener like sucralose affects blood sugar levels and insulin levels. This is a very important topic in the nutrition field as diabetes is very prevalent and identifying if artificial sweeteners can be a safe replacement for sugar is important. In this project, I further improved my research and analysis skills by getting more experience researching a certain controversial topic and forming my own conclusions based on the evidence available. This is a very important skill because research is the basis of dietary recommendations and being able to conduct your own research on a certain topic, especially a controversial topic, is important to continue to implement research-based practice.\n\n\n\n\nPresentation on the Efficacy of probiotics for the treatment of IBS\n\n\nView Project\n\n\n\nIn one of my graduate level classes on advanced topics in macro and micronutrients, we researched the efficacy of a certain treatment for a certain disease/condition. I chose to do my project on the impact probiotic supplementation on irritable bowel syndrome. This is a very important topic as more and more companies are starting to sell probiotics and lots of non-science-based articles are promoting probiotic supplementation for irritable bowel syndrome. Through this project, I learned how to research a certain topic and present this information to an audience. I learned that there is some evidence supporting probiotic use for irritable bowel syndrome, however, the evidence is low-quality and more research in this area is still needed. Being able to identify effective dietary interventions for a certain disease/condition by analyzing the current research on a topic is crucial for dietitians to be able to recommend effective dietary interventions.\n\n\n\n\nFood Product Development Project\n\n\nView Project\n\n\n\nIn this project, we worked in teams to develop a food product that adds something new to the market. In this process, we had to analyze the markets, both physical locations and online food markets, to evaluate the current products being sold. We had to identify a food product that we wanted to make and certain aspects that are missing in that food product. Our group worked together and decided on making a vegan whole grain version of a Rice Krispy treat as we noticed that there are hardly any vegan options for this product and that there are no whole grain Rice Krispy bars. We then went into the iterative prototype development stages by starting with a recipe, modifying only one ingredient at a time, and performing sensory evaluations. We performed these evaluations for a few weeks until we decided on a final product. In this experience, I learned how product development and sensory evaluation analysis is conducted. Understanding consumer acceptance and sensory appeal are two important aspects to understand to promote healthy dietary eating habits."

    "text": "Qualitative Study on the Impact of Childhood Experiences on Student’s Eating Habits\n\n\nView Project\n\n\n\nIn this project, I worked in teams to develop a research project, develop a qualitative research questionnaire, conduct qualitative interviews with participants, and analyze the data. Our group chose to do our project on the impact of childhood experiences on students’ eating habits. We conducted a literature review on this topic to identify any gaps in the literature. Then, we created our own qualitative interview questions, recruited participants, and conducted our own interviews. Lastly, we analyzed the transcripts from all of the participants and identified important themes that were present. This was the very first time that I had worked on a qualitative research project. Most of my experience has been in quantitative measurements and being able to get experience in a qualitative approach helped me better understand how this type of research is conducted. This is an important topic in the nutrition field as being able to understand both quantitative and qualitative topics is crucial.\n\n\n\n\nStatewide Basic Needs and Student Success\n\n\nView Project\n\n\n\nOne of the projects that I have worked on extensively with the Center for Healthy Communities is the Basic Needs and Student Success Survey. This project involves surveying college students in California on a variety of factors such as the impact of basic needs resources, eating habits, physical activity patterns, and mental health. We have recruited over 2000 student participants for the statewide study and have summarized all the results on a website using GitHub and R studio. This was a very large project involving the effort of multiple people in developing the survey, collecting the data from 12 college campuses, cleaning all the data, and analyzing the data. I learned how to work in a large team and how to display complex graphs and tables to be easily interpreted by the general audience. These are all important skills as being able to work in large teams is crucial in the healthcare field and being able to provide and explain complex information in simple terms is important to ensure that patients understand the information given to them.\n\n\n\n\nAssociation Between Stress and College Students’ Appetites\n\n\nView Project\n\n\n\nIn this project, I worked in a team to create a small research project to assess an important gap in the literature. As a team, we created our own survey using Qualtrics including validated survey tools, distributed this survey, and used SPSS to analyze the data. My analysis focused on assessing the association between stress and appetite where I used a linear regression model with various covariates. I found a positive association between stress and appetite among college students. In other words, as college student’s stress levels increased, there was an association with an increase in college student’s appetites. This was the first research project that I had conducted, and I learned how to develop and organize a research project. This is relevant to the nutrition field as being able to understand research and research methodology is crucial to implement evidence-based practice."
