In this project, I worked in a team to create a small research project. First, we found a gap in the literature about a certain topic. Then we researched relevant survey tools to help us assess this gap and created our own survey using Qualtrics. We then distributed this survey to instructors through email to send to their students. After we collected a reasonable sample size, we used SPSS to analyze the data. In the analysis, I used a linear regression model with various covariates. I found a positive association between stress and appetite in college students. In other words, as college student’s stress levels increased, there was an association with an increase in college student’s appetites. This was the first research project that I had conducted, and I learned how to develop and organize a research project. This is relevant to the nutrition field as being able to understand research and research methodology is crucial to implement evidence-based practice.

In one of my classes, about dietary supplements and functional foods, we conducted our own literature review about a certain supplement and posed our own conclusions on the efficacy of that supplement on treating a certain condition. I chose to research ashwagandha and stress since there have been a lot of supplement companies selling ashwagandha for stress and I wanted to know if there was any research to support this. Through this project, I further increased my ability and skills to research a certain topic and use that evidence to make an unbiased conclusion. This will be helpful in the future working as a dietitian as I am sure there will be a lot of questions from clients asking about certain supplements. Being able to dive into the research is crucial to see if there is actually any benefit to taking a certain supplement and providing this information without any bias is also important.

In a class on nutrition throughout the lifecycle, one of our projects was to conduct a 24-hour dietary recall on a pregnant woman and identify any potential nutrient deficiencies based on the recommended dietary intakes. After conducting the dietary recall, we entered all of the food eaten by that person into a nutrition database to calculate macro and micronutrient intake. We then wrote a report on these findings. In this experience, I learned how to conduct a 24-hour dietary recall and learned how to identify any nutrient deficiencies through the use of a nutrition database. These are very important skills to know as dietitians where we will likely be conducting many 24-hour dietary recalls or just gathering general dietary intake. Knowing how to gather the right information is crucial in order to make appropriate recommendations. This is especially important in pregnant women where inadequate nutrient intake may be common.

In a class on Advanced Human Nutrition, I worked in a team to write a report on a controversial topic. My group chose to research how an artificial sweetener like sucralose affects blood sugar levels and insulin levels. This is a very important topic in the nutrition field as diabetes is very prevalent and identifying if artificial sweeteners can be a safe replacement for sugar is important. In this project, I further improved my research and analysis skills by getting more experience researching a certain controversial topic and forming my own conclusions based on the evidence available. This is a very important skill because research is the basis of dietary recommendations and being able to conduct your own research on a certain topic, especially a controversial topic, is important to continue to implement research-based practice. We also worked in groups on this project, which gave me more experience working in teams.

-	In one of my graduate level classes on advanced topics in macro and micronutrients, we researched the efficacy of a certain treatment for a certain disease/condition. I chose to do my project on the impact probiotic supplementation on irritable bowel syndrome. This is a very important topic as more and more companies are starting to sell probiotics and lots of non-science-based articles are promoting probiotic supplementation for irritable bowel syndrome. Through this project, I learned how to research a certain topic and present this information to an audience. I learned that there is some evidence supporting probiotic use for irritable bowel syndrome, however, the evidence is low-quality and more research in this area is still needed. Being able to identify effective dietary interventions for a certain disease/condition by analyzing the current research on a topic is crucial for dietitians to be able to recommend effective dietary interventions.
