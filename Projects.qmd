In one of my classes, about dietary supplements and functional foods, we conducted our own literature review about a certain supplement and posed our own conclusions on the efficacy of that supplement on treating a certain condition. I chose to research ashwagandha and stress since there have been a lot of supplement companies selling ashwagandha for stress and I wanted to know if there was any research to support this. Through this project, I further increased my ability and skills to research a certain topic and use that evidence to make an unbiased conclusion. This will be helpful in the future working as a dietitian as I am sure there will be a lot of questions from clients asking about certain supplements. Being able to dive into the research is crucial to see if there is actually any benefit to taking a certain supplement and providing this information without any bias is also important.

In a class on nutrition throughout the lifecycle, one of our projects was to conduct a 24-hour dietary recall on a pregnant woman and identify any potential nutrient deficiencies based on the recommended dietary intakes. After conducting the dietary recall, we entered all of the food eaten by that person into a nutrition database to calculate macro and micronutrient intake. We then wrote a report on these findings. In this experience, I learned how to conduct a 24-hour dietary recall and learned how to identify any nutrient deficiencies through the use of a nutrition database. These are very important skills to know as dietitians where we will likely be conducting many 24-hour dietary recalls or just gathering general dietary intake. Knowing how to gather the right information is crucial in order to make appropriate recommendations. This is especially important in pregnant women where inadequate nutrient intake may be common.

In a class on Advanced Human Nutrition, I worked in a team to write a report on a controversial topic. My group chose to research how an artificial sweetener like sucralose affects blood sugar levels and insulin levels. This is a very important topic in the nutrition field as diabetes is very prevalent and identifying if artificial sweeteners can be a safe replacement for sugar is important. In this project, I further improved my research and analysis skills by getting more experience researching a certain controversial topic and forming my own conclusions based on the evidence available. This is a very important skill because research is the basis of dietary recommendations and being able to conduct your own research on a certain topic, especially a controversial topic, is important to continue to implement research-based practice. We also worked in groups on this project, which gave me more experience working in teams.

In one of my graduate level classes on advanced topics in macro and micronutrients, we researched the efficacy of a certain treatment for a certain disease/condition. I chose to do my project on the impact probiotic supplementation on irritable bowel syndrome. This is a very important topic as more and more companies are starting to sell probiotics and lots of non-science-based articles are promoting probiotic supplementation for irritable bowel syndrome. Through this project, I learned how to research a certain topic and present this information to an audience. I learned that there is some evidence supporting probiotic use for irritable bowel syndrome, however, the evidence is low-quality and more research in this area is still needed. Being able to identify effective dietary interventions for a certain disease/condition by analyzing the current research on a topic is crucial for dietitians to be able to recommend effective dietary interventions.

In this project, we worked in teams to develop a food product that adds something new to the market. In this process, we had to analyze the markets, both physical locations and online food markets, to evaluate the current products being sold. We had to identify a food product that we wanted to make and certain aspects that are missing in that food product. Our group worked together and decided on making a vegan whole grain version of a Rice Krispy treat as we noticed that there are hardly any vegan options for this product and that there are no brown Rice Krispy bars. We then went into the iterative prototype development stages by starting with a recipe, modifying only one ingredient at a time, and performing sensory evaluations. We performed these evaluations for a few weeks until we decided on a final product. In this experience, I learned how product development and sensory evaluation analysis is conducted. Understanding consumer acceptance and sensory appeal are two important aspects to understand to promote healthy dietary eating habits.
